  I am a consultant at Microsoft where I work to help Micosoft's customers  drive adaptive and dynamic solutions in cloud optimization and infrastructure on Azure. However, this site isn't made to focus on Azure. I created this site for 3 reasons:

  - To learn how to build a blog using RStudio for the fun of it
  - To remind myself of database concepts
  - To hone in on my technical writing skills

  *Emphasis on "the fun of it"*
  
  More about me, I studied computer science, finishing my bachelor's in 2020 (in the midst of a pandemic). I love making beautiful charts, the declarative programming language SQL, salsa dancing, coffee, and tea.

  This blog is built with blogdown and Hugo, and deployed using Netlify.
