# Chapter 1

## Database Management System
A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of related data a set of programs to access those datasets.

### Examples of Database Applications
  - Balancing transactions
  - University, grades, registration

### Drawbacks of file systems to store data
  - Data Inconsistency and redundancy
  - Difficulty in accessing data
  - Data Isolation
  - Integrity Problem/constraints e.g. balance > 0
  - Atomicity ofupdates
    - actions should happen all together or not at all
  - Concurrent access by multiple users
  - Security problems
  -   Not every user of the database system should be able to access all data


## An Architecture for DBMS
<Insert image>

**Schema** - the logical structure of the database (overall design)  <br />
**Instance** - actual content of the databse at a particular point in time
  
## Data Models
  - A collection of tools for describing
    - data
    - data relationships
    - data semantics
    - data constraints
    ex: Relational Model
      - a collection of tables to represent data and relationships
